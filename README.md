## _A script to make your DayZ server installation better_

Bexelon is a Powershell script created to install your DayZ server and auto-updates your mods fully automatically. You just have one file to configure, you can then let the script make your installation.

## Features

- Install a new DayZ server or add Bexelon to an existing server
- Choose between your own local mod list or an online Steam mod Collection (from Steam Workshop)
- Enable or disable Battleye Anti-Cheat
- Auto-update mods from Steam Workshop and DayZ Server when the the script is executed and at every server reboot

## Prerequisites

You can find the necessary tools for the Bexelon script installation down below :

- [Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview) - Terminal (required to run this script)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Git version control system (not required if you download this repo as zip)
- [steamcmd.exe](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD#Downloading_SteamCMD) - The Steam Console Client (not required now !)

## Installation

Bexelon requires [Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview) 5 or higher to work.

If you want to install Bexelon for a new server, create a folder where you want to create your server (you can give it the name of your choice), start Powershell and clone this repo into the folder that you have created.

If you want to install Bexelon in an existing server, just clone the repo at the root of your server. This will create a folder named `Bexelon`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Firebels/Bexelon.git
```

## Configuration

Before launching the script, you have to edit the **config.xml** file located in the Bexelon directory. The configuration file is split into multiple parts.
Here will only be listed the important parameters.

Configure your server profile name (you can leave the default setting) :

```xml
<Settings>
	<Profile>ServerProfile</Profile>		<!-- The Server Profile you want to use (ex: ServerName) -->
	<BattleEye>False</BattleEye>			<!-- Enable BattleEye Anti-Cheat [True/False]? -->
</Settings>
```

> To set `BattleEye` to **true**, you have to put the BattleEye folder into your server folder.

**BE AWARE!** The script files cannot be stored in the root location path of the DayZ server folder that you have created or your existing server folder, unless they are stored in a subfolder (named Bexelon) of the DayZ server folder.

#### Configure your mods source :

```xml
<Game>
	<UseLocalModList>True</UseLocalModList>		<!-- Set True to use LocalModList.txt -->
	<CollectionId>2376686769</CollectionId>		<!-- Set Steam Workshop Collection ID (If API List) -->
</Game>
```

> If you want a Vanilla server without mods, set `UseLocalModList` to **True** and delete all of the **LocalModList.txt** content.
> Set `UseLocalModList` to **True** to use the **LocalModList.txt** mod list.
> The  `CollectionId` setting is used when `UseLocalModList` is set to **False**. This will detect all mods in your workshop collection.

#### Configure your Steam credentials :

Your Steam credentials are used to download the Steam workshop content.

```xml
<Credentials> 
	<Username>username</Username>		<!-- Set steam username -->
	<Password>password</Password>		<!-- Set steam password -->
</Credentials>
```

> Enter your Steam credentials : For security reasons it is recommended that you create a new Steam account just for your dedicated servers.

## The LocalModList.txt

If you have enabled the `UseLocalModList` parameter, you can configure **LocalModList.txt** now. Use the format you want. You can find this file at the root of the script, if not exist create one.

Example :

```
### Standard mods ###
CF = 1559212036 you can put URL or not (this mod will be loaded)
Community online tools = https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1564026768
Ignore this mod: ~1564026799 (ignored)
```

> You can put **EVERYTHING** you want in this file. As long as the file contains a workshop mod ID (10-digit), the script will detect it, **no matter where it is in the file!**
To comment (and therefore ignore) a mod, add `~` in front of it.

## Launch the server (or install your new server)

To launch your DayZ server, you just have to start the **run.ps1** script.

```sh
./run.ps1
```

- If you launch the script for a new DayZ server installation, the script will install all the necessary files from the server to the path you configured in `Path/Server`. Once it completes this process, it will download the mods you filled in and launch the server.

- If you launch the script for an existing server, the script will only install missing mods and and launch the server.

> Powershell will surely ask you to make a choice regarding the execution policy :

## Server restarting

If Bexelon is open and your server closes, the script go to the startup process, so it updates server and mods, and the server retart.

## Server updating

Your DayZ steam server will check update at each restart. The update will be installed automatically.

## Mod installation

Add a new mod into the **LocalModList.txt** or into your Steam Workshop Collection (it depends on the `useLocalModList` parameter), and start (or restart) the script. The new mods will be installed on your DayZ server folder, and the .keys files will be pushed into the keys folder automatically.

The downloaded mods will take the official name given on steam workshop. This will create a folder into your root server folder named `@mod1` for example.

## Mod update

Your mods will be updated automatically each time you start the script (or when your server restart). 
The mods concerned will be those that you put in your local mod list or those present in the workshop collection that you have configured in **config.xml**.

## Server configuration

You have to configure your mods yourself by entering into your server profile folder ðŸ™‚
